    <h2>Anelisa Ozolin</h2>
    <h2>Anne</h2>
    <p>Hello everyone!</p>
    <p>My name is Anelisa, but my friends usually call me Anne, 
        I live in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil, with my husband and our little dog, a Pomeranian named Koda. 
        I am 26 years old, I served a mission in Curitiba Brazil from 2016 to 2017.</p>
    <p>One unique thing about me is that I love books, 
        since I was little I read a lot of books and I always like to have them around me. 
        In the last few years, I have discovered how wonderful it is to have a Kindle, 
        and since then whenever I stop somewhere I open my current book and start reading. 
        My favorite books are fantasy and science fiction, 
        but I love classic and huge books a lot, like War and Peace and The Count of Monte Cristo.</p>
    <p>This semester I decided to change my major. 
        I was doing Business Management, but I decided to change to applied Technology. 
        It was a hard decision, and I made it after ponder and praying a lot, 
        but I feel it was the right decision as I already got a job and I started working as Data Analyst. 
        I am so grateful that I can count on Heavenly Father's help in my professional decisions.</p> 
    <p>I look forward to learning a lot from you all this semester, 
        I know we have a lot to learn from each other.</p>

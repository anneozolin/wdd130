        About Me
I am a Brazilian woman, 26 years old. I live in São Paulo, Brazil, with my husband and our little dog, a Pomeranian.
I am an introverted and dreaming person, I love to study, and above all, I am passionate about books. I discovered reading when I was a child, and since that time I have never stopped reading.
On this site, I bring you the five best series of fantasy books, series that I read when I was still a child and that awakened in me the love I feel for books. They are a series of books that can be read at any age, and each one of them presents us with a new world of discoveries and magic, to delight all readers.

        5th Eragon
A boy... a dragon... a world of adventures.
Eragon is a young peasant who, upon finding a polished blue stone in the forest, finds himself overnight at the center of an ancient power struggle. The blue stone is actually a dragon egg. When he breaks apart, giving birth to Saphira, Eragon is forced to become a hero to save the realm of Alagaësia.
In four breathtaking volumes – Eragon, Eldest, Brisingr, and Inheritance – Eragon meets different beings and places, makes friends and enemies, falls in love, faces difficult challenges, and fights dangerous battles. Alongside Saphira, his female dragon and loyal companion, Eragon has many victories, but he also collects the pains of very difficult losses. His journey, which is also a journey to maturity, combines action, adventure, and fantasy with the tradition of the best formative novels.
Eragon was given the responsibility of achieving the glory of the legendary heroes of the Order of Dragon knights. Will he be able to overcome the obstacles that fate has in store for him? Now his choices could save or destroy the world he lives in.

        4th Percy Jackson
The first volume of the Percy Jackson and the Olympians saga, The Lightning Thief was among the first places on The New York Times bestselling series list. The author combines legends from Greek mythology with adventures in the 21st century. In them, the gods of Olympus are still alive, still falling in love with mortals and giving birth to half-god, half-human children, like the heroes of ancient Greece. Marked by fate, they hardly make it past adolescence. Few manage to discover their identity.
Problem boy Percy Jackson is one of them. He has strange experiences where gods and mythological monsters seem to leap from the pages of books straight into his life. Worse than that: some of these creatures are quite angry. A precious artifact has been stolen from Mount Olympus and Percy is the prime suspect. To restore peace, he and his friends - young modern heroes - will have to do more than capture the real thief: they must uncover a betrayal more threatening than the fury of the gods.

        3th The Chronicles of Narnia
Journeys to the end of the world, fantastical creatures, and epic battles between good and evil - what more could a reader want from a book? The book that has it all is The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe, written in 1949 by Clive Staples Lewis. But Lewis didn't stop there. Six other books followed, and together they became known as 'The Chronicles of Narnia'. Over the past fifty years, 'The Chronicles of Narnia' has transcended the fantasy genre to become part of the canon of classical literature. Each of the seven books is a masterpiece, drawing the reader into a world where magic meets reality, and the result is a fictional world that has fascinated generations.

        2nd Lord of the Rings
Sauron, the Dark Lord, has gathered to him all the Rings of Power — the means by which he intends to rule Middle-earth. All he lacks in his plans for dominion is the One Ring the ring that rules them all which has fallen into the hands of the hobbit, Bilbo Baggins.
In a sleepy village in the Shire, young Frodo Baggins finds himself faced with an immense task, as his elderly cousin Bilbo entrusts the Ring to his care. Frodo must leave his home and make a perilous journey across Middle-earth to the Cracks of Doom, there to destroy the Ring and foil the Dark Lord in his evil purpose.
Since it was first published in 1954, The Lord of the Rings has been a book people have treasured. Steeped in unrivaled magic and otherworldliness, its sweeping fantasy has touched the hearts of young and old alike.

        1st Harry Potter
The life of the boy Harry Potter does not have an iota of magic. He lives with his uncles and cousin, who don't like him at all. Harry's room is actually a closet under the stairs, and he's never celebrated a birthday in eleven years. Until, one day, Harry receives a mysterious letter, delivered by an owl: an invitation to study at an amazing place called Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. There he will find not only friends, sports practiced on flying brooms, and magic everywhere, but also his destiny: to be a sorcerer's apprentice until the day he will have to face the worst force of evil, the wizard who murdered his parents. But for that, Harry will need to go through a series of challenges and face countless dangers. In seven books that have become the biggest publishing phenomenon of all time, with more than 450 million copies sold and translations into 78 languages, Harry Potter isn't just exposed to battles and spells. He needs to overcome betrayals, and surprises and, above all, learn to deal with his own feelings. Love, friendship, and, of course, a good dose of magic and imagination, are the key elements of the greatest wizarding saga of all time.
